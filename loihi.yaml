# timing possible values: 
# clock: the timestep / event takes a fixed time based on clock frequency - how do we define clock speed? Probably a technology parameter
#   we could still model the timing but in the end we just overwrite it with the clock freq (and raise an error if the sim time took longer)
# parallel: All instances run in parallel. Each has its own timing.
# global_sync: similar to parallel, take the max timing of any instances + sync time
# multiplexed: Each instance must run one after the other. 
#  -- something more complex might be event drive time simulation, interaction between blocks is modelled. But thats probably another parameter
