# format is always the type letter, followed by the id, followed by the list of
#  relevant parameters
# a field is either a letter field or integer field for now
#  a letter field is a single ascii char
#  an integer field is either a single value, a list of numbers (e.g. 0,1,5,3) or a
#   range of numbers [inclusive] (e.g. 0..3 == 0,1,2,3), or x if does not exist / apply

# should i be more consistent, and use a csv format here too?
