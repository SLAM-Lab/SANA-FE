# Exercise 1. Define a new mapped neuron: 1.1. To do this, add another neuron to group 1 (i.e. increment the number of neurons in the group), define neuron 1.1 with no attributes (leave it blank), and map neuron 1.1 to core 0.1
# Exercise 2. Add edges from neurons 0.0 and 0.1, both to neuron 1.1, with weights -2 & 3 respectively
# Exercise 3. Set the bias of neuron 0.1 to 0.5
# Exercise 4. Configure Group 1 to use the new compressed synapses that you defined H/W for in architecture description, instead of the uncompressed synapses used currently
