# Exercise 1. Add one neuron to group 1, define neuron 1.1 with no attributes and map neuron 1.1 to core 0.1
# Exercise 2. Add edges from neurons 0.0 and 0.1, both to neuron 1.1, with weights -2 & 3 respectively
# Exercise 3. Set the bias of neuron 0.1 to 0.5

## Groups and neurons
# Group 0
g 2 threshold=1.0 reset=0.0 log_spikes=1 log_v=1
# Group 1
g 1 threshold=2.0 reset=0.0

n 0.0 bias=0.2 connections_out=2
n 0.1 connections_out=1
n 1.0 bias=0.0

## Edges
e 0.0->1.0 weight=-1.0

## Mappings
